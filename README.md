# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations to uncover patterns and insights within a dataset. The analysis is documented in an R Markdown file (`Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization.Rmd`).

## Data Source
Datasets used in this project are obtained from public repositories and referenced within the R Markdown file.

- **Primary Data Source**:
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)

## Project Structure
- `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization.Rmd`: R Markdown file with EDA and visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory for datasets.
- `output/`: Folder for EDA results and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions.

## Summary
This project involves cleaning data, performing EDA, and visualizing the results. The visualizations help identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data.

## Installation and Usage
Install R and the following packages:

- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `tidyr`
- `plotly`

### Steps to Run:
